# twitter-firehose

Experimenting with pulling time periods (in the region of 100s of ms) of tweets, using [Jason Baumgartner's tweet ID prediction efforts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVrPoNutyqTdQ04DXBEZW4ZW4A5RAQW2he7qIpTmG-M/)

## Usage

1. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
2. Add your Twitter API keys (multiple apps & users accepted)
3. `npm install` dependencies
4. `npm start` to run
5. Check `output` directory for pulled tweets

## Example output

Assuming you have 49 API keys in your config, and set the time period to 1 minute...

```
$ node index.js

* We have to check 12000000 IDs that could have been generated in 1 minute
* The 49 tokens provided can make up to 30300 API calls every 15 minutes
* Each API call can check 100 IDs, so this process can take between 45 and 60 minutes

Fetching tweets [                    ] 0%  ‚è≥ 0.0s  ‚åõÔ∏è 0.0s  üê¶ 49/49
```

The progress bar shows:

- ‚è≥ Time elapsed
- ‚åõÔ∏è Estimated time remaining
- üê¶ Unexpired tokens / Total tokens

Once the process completes, `./output/1551854632523_1551854632524.csv` will contain:

```csv
